- This will create the display portion of the app
- The next tutorial will use this piece as a foundation
- NOTE: Tutorial steps that start with 'Fill in' have a code file associated with them in this folder


Prerequisites:
- Npm, nodejs and npx installed
- Should also be able to use them from the command line
- VSCode recommended


The tutorial as a series of steps
1. Creating the react base repo:
	a. Npx create-react-app alimb-front-end
2. Open the created folder in VSCode
3. Open the terminal in VSCode
4. Install the following nodejs packages using npm:  
	a. Npm I @material-ui/core  
5. Delete the following files from the src folder  
	- App.css  
	- Index.css  
	- App.test.js  
	- serviceWorker.js  
	- Logo.svg  
	- In src/index.js  
		- Delete the import for index.css  
		- Delete the import for service worker  
		- Delete the serviceWorker.unregister() line at the end of the file  
	- In src/App.js  
		- Delete the import for logo.svg  
		- Delete the import App.css  
6. Make the src/App.js file render return an empty divT  
7. Create a folder to hold components,  
	- Suitably, we will call this folder components  
8. We are going to create 7 javascript files in the components folder  
	- TodoList.js  
	- CategoryList.js  
	- AddCategory.js  
	- AddTodo.js  
	- MainArea.js  
	- TitleBar.js  
	- CategoryDrawer.js  
9. Fill in the TitleBar.js file  
	- Import it to App.js, and make sure it looks okay  
10. Fill in the MainArea.js file  
	- Import it to App.js, and make sure it looks okay  
11. Fill in AddTodo.js file  
	- Import it to App.js, and make sure it looks okay  
12. Fill in the TodoList.js file  
	- Import it to App.js, and make sure it looks okay  
13. Fill in the CategoryDrawer.js file  
	- Import it to App.js, and make sure it looks okay  
14. Fill in the AddCategory.js file  
	- Import it to App.js, and make sure it looks okay  
15. Fill in the CategoryList.js file  
	- Import it to App.js, and make sure it looks okay  
16. Import all the items into src/App.js  



1. You'll notice that the category drawer overlaps the main area and the titlebar  
	- This will be addressed in tutorial stage 2 of this tutorial series, by injecting redux state into material ui styles. This injection of state will allow the user to open/close the drawer by clicking a button on the TitleBar.  
2. If you have all 7 components on screen and rendering correctly, you're ready for the next tutorial. Thanks for following along!
